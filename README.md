# Machine-Learning

Linear regression - makes predictions by plotting a straight line that approximately fits our data set.
It also makes the use of the cost function which will determine the error between the predicting value and the actual value.
This cost function which is the representation of the error to be minimum.
Gradient descent algorithm is used to find the minimum value of the cost function.

Decision Tree - A decision tree is a type of supervised machine learning used to categorize or make predictions based on how a previous set of questions were answered. The model is a form of supervised learning, meaning that the model is trained and tested on a set of data that contains the desired categorization.
