Linear regression makes predictions by plotting a straight line that approximately fits our data set.
It also makes the use of the cost function which will determine the error between the predicting value and the actual value.
This cost function which is the representation of the error to be minimum.
Gradient descent algorithm is used to find the minimum value of the cost function.
